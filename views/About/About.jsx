          <p>
            I started my engineering journey learning python basics, moving onto
            Javascript & JQuery and later learning React 16. During my role as
            Innovation Product Manager I was able to assist in the build phase
            of new product concepts, building user interfaces for blockchain,
            savings and mortgage journeys. I continued to deepen my knowledge of
            React, utilising resources such as; Robin Weiruch's Road to React,
            Maximillian Schwarzm√ºller's complete guide and Bruno Simon's
            Three.js & React-three-fiber. In 2024 I also completed a full-stack
            Javascript Software Engineering course at Northcoders coding school.
