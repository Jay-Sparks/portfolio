        <h2>Software Engineering</h2>
        <p>I started my engineering journey learning python basics, 
          moving onto Javascript & JQuery and later learning React 16. 
          During my role as Innovation Product Manager I was able to assist in the build phase of new product concepts, 
          building user interfaces for blockchain, savings and mortgage journeys.
          I continued to deepen my knowledge of React, utilising resources such as;
           Robin Weiruch's Road to React, 
           Maximillian Schwarzm√ºller's complete guide and 
           Bruno Simon's Three.js & React-three-fiber. 
           In 2024 I also completed a full-stack Javascript Software Engineering course at Northcoders coding school.
